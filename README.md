# HotlineMultiplayer
A Hotline maimi multiplayer clone.

This is a simple project with a simple goal: Make hotline maimi (lite) with multiplayer.
By hotline maimi lite I simply mean that this game won't include all the HLM features.
The core of hlm will be here however, for ex. inst death, topdown, brutal finishers, etc.

Another cut feature from HLM will be the mask system. You will all be playing the same character from the get go, however there might be some weapon choices from the start. The reason for this cut is simply time. This feature could take a month or two to implement properly, and I just don't plan to spend that much time on this. I may change my mind later on down the road, but this is off the burners entirely for now.

As far as level flow would go, you and your friends will all be able to see into any room just as in HLM1. Once a player dies they switch to spectating mode, and can continue to move around the map at will but will have no interaction with the world. Once all players are dead the level would result in a game over. To start a level all players must concent by pressing the ready key.

This will be a Windows PC exclusive, but if I get time I might add a Linux port. There will be no Mac or console support, aint no body got time for that.

One thing that will be changed to make the game a little more accessable is I will be adding a "difficulty" section.
You will be able to choose from 1 of 3 options. 
Each player will be able to pick their difficulty before they start a mission.
To encourage players to pick the intended difficulty there will be score bonuses the higher up your difficulty is.

1. New to hotline: Gives you three hits before you die, and no score bonuses.
2. Suck at hotline: Gives you two hits before you die, and a 2x score bonus.
3. Intended: Gives you one hit before you die, and a 3x score bonus.

You can play single player, but obviously it's not the intended route. If you play single player you are choosing to fuck yourself as the diffuclty wont be scaled back or up the more or less players you choose to play with.

Possible features to add include: 
• Pinging enemies and/or other player but only if you have hand radios.
• Optional friendly fire on.
• Kill streak rewards like being able to move faster when you kill 'x' enemies.
• Medical equipment can heal downed players.
• No man down game mode where if even one person dies it results in a game over.
• Endless waves mode.
• Custom skins.
• Other options for completing levels, such as hacking a terminal or capturing some intel.
