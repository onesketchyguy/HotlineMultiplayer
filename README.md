# HotlineMultiplayer
 Hotline maimi multiplayer clone.

This is a simple project with a simple goal: Make hotline maimi (lite) with multiplayer.
By hotline maimi lite I simply mean that this game won't include all the hlm features.
The core of hlm will be here however, for ex. inst death, topdown, bodies stay.

One thing that will be changed to make the game a little more accessable is I will be adding a "difficulty" section.
You will be able to choose from 1 of 3 options. 

1. New to hotline: Gives you three hits before you die.
2. Suck at hotline: Gives you two hits before you die.
3. Intended: Gives you one hit before you die.

Each player will be able to pick their difficulty before they start a mission.
To encourage players to pick the intended difficulty there will be score bonuses the higher up your difficulty is.
The difficulty would act as a direct score multiplier. Ex. level 2 would be 2x score multipler.

You can play single player, but obviously it's not the intended route. If you play single player you are choosing to fuck yourself.
